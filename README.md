Overview
I chose Bubble Sort after asking my computer science roommate which algorithm to study—he suggested Bubble Sort!

I wrote a simple Python program that lets users sort lists of different sizes. It tracks:

Time taken

Number of comparisons

Number of swaps

Features
Users can input the size of the list

Tracks performance

Real-time graph using matplotlib

Slows down to show each swap step-by-step using time.sleep

Manual step-through mode

Text-only version without graphics

How Bubble Sort Works
Bubble Sort compares pairs of numbers and swaps them if they’re out of order. It keeps doing this until the list is sorted. Smaller numbers “bubble” to the top of the list.

Time Complexity
Worst case: O(n²) — list is in reverse order

Best case: O(n) — list is already sorted and no swaps are needed

Space: O(1) — does not use extra space

Conclusion
Bubble Sort is easy to understand and great for learning how sorting works, but it's not efficient for large lists. This project helped me learn how to analyze and visualize algorithms.
