## 📘 Overview

I chose Bubble Sort after asking my computer science roommate which algorithm to study—he suggested Bubble Sort!

I wrote a simple Python program that lets users sort lists of different sizes. It tracks:

- Time taken  
- Number of comparisons  
- Number of swaps

## 🛠️ Features

- User input to set list size  
- Performance tracking (time, comparisons, swaps)  
- Real-time graph using `matplotlib`  
- Slows down to show each swap using `time.sleep`  
- Manual step-through version  
- Text-only version (no graphics)

## 🔄 How Bubble Sort Works

Bubble Sort goes through a list, compares each pair of items, and swaps them if they are out of order. This repeats until the list is sorted. Smaller values “bubble” to the top.

## ⏱️ Time Complexity

- **Worst case:** O(n²) – when the list is in reverse order  
- **Best case:** O(n) – when the list is already sorted  
- **Space complexity:** O(1) – uses no extra memory

## ✅ Conclusion

Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm and great for learning. It’s not efficient for large lists, but it helped me understand how sorting works and how to visualize it using code.
